\section{Future works}
\label{sec:future_works}

This chapter recovers the suggested future implementations scattered in the
previous sections, along with some new ideas expressed in a more detailed and
uniform way.

An important point could be making a comparison between the \texttt{Sweep Angle
Algorithm} (see chapter \ref{subsec:sweep_metric_algorithm}) and the 3rd method
described in article \cite{sugimoto} (pages 6 and 7).
The formula used in \cite{sugimoto} to compare the view-point of an image with
the robot's current position and direction is not clear at all. Some parameters
are ambiguous and there is not an exhaustive explanation about the formula that
ties them together.

After resolving and implementing the formula, it could be interesting to evaluate
the same case tests with the two approaches, in order to underline the advantages
and the disadvantages shown by each method and compare them.
