\chapter{An exocentric vision system for \morduc{}}
\label{concr}
\minitoc

This chapter will show how to use \framework{} to implement a 
concrete exocentric vision system, specifically designed for 
\morduc{}.
\\
As section \ref{rear} explains, in order to get things 
done, all we need to write is:

\begin{itemize}
\item an implementation of the \texttt{IDataLogic} interface
\item an implementation of the \texttt{IImageSelector} interface
\item a concrete subclass of \texttt{Robot}
\end{itemize}

The class diagram of the complete system is reported in figure
\ref{fig:class_diagram_complete}. 
\\
Three concrete classes implement the \textit{IDataLogic} interface,
each one retrieving robot information from different kinds of source.
They are named \textit{DataLogicLogSimulator}, \textit{DataLogicLogMorduc}
and \textit{DataLogicMorduc}, exposed in section \ref{concr:idatalogic}.
\\
As it's easy to notice, class diagram presents also three implementations 
of the \texttt{IImageSelector} interface: \texttt{SpacialMetricCalc},
\texttt{SweepMetricCalc} and \texttt{AnotherSweepMetricCalc}
(an improvement algorithm from the previous one).
The latter encapsulate two brand new selection algorithms,
widely discussed later from section
\ref{concr:iimageselector:sweep_metric_algorithm} to section
\ref{concr:iimageselector:another_sweep_metric_class}.
\texttt{SpacialMetricCalc} is a variant 
of the image selection method number two reported in \cite{sugimoto}, 
whose possible implementation is showed in sections
\ref{concr:iimageselector:spacial_metric_algorithm} and
\ref{concr:iimageselector:spacial_metric_class}.

\\
As regards classes derived from \textit{Robot}, the only one proposed
is \textit{Morduc} (section \ref{concr:robot_classes}), because
the concrete \framework{} exocentric vision
is built around \morduc{} robot (exposed in section \ref{intro:3morduc}).
