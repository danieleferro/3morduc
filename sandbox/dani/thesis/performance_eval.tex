\chapter{Performance Evaluation}
\label{sec:performance_evaluation}
\minitoc

This chapter will describe some tests performed at the 
University of Hertfordshire (Hatfield, UK), along with 
their results. 
\\
The algorithm presented in \ref{concr:iimageselector:sweep_metric_algorithm}
(named \textit{SweepMetricAlgorithm}) was used as image
selection algorithm. Several tests 
have been carried out, each time changing the passed parameters
(see \ref{concr:iimageselector:sweep_metric_class}).
\\
The test target is to underline the main differences 
occurring when one or more parameters change their values, 
within defined ranges. After asking users their options 
and perceptions about teleguiding the robot with an 
exocentric vision system, we could at the end identify 
the advantages and the disadvantages correlated with 
different sets of initial parameters.
\\
Since tests have been carried out using saved logs 
(see section \ref{concr:idatalogic:datalogiclogsimulator}),
users were not 
able to actually command the robot, but simply 
to request the application to go one step
further and, hence, just see the robot moving along 
the trajectory it performed during a recorded 
session.
\\
Be advised that, due to the low number of testers, 
the obtained results have not statical validity.
On the other hand, they were useful to identify 
a possible future improvement of the algorithm,
built later with \textit{Another Sweep Metric Algorithm} 
(see section \ref{concr:iimageselector:another_sweep_metric_algorithm}).
