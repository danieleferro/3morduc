rear - a framework for virtual exocentric vision systems of
       mobile robots

Brief description
-----------------

rear is a c++ framework that implements a minimal set of
tools and functionalities needed by a virtual 
exocentric vision system, that is, a software that makes 
you able to create an external visualization of a robot 
using a egocentric-mounted camera and augmented reality 
techniques.

Dependencies
------------

Rear is written in C++ and makes use of OpenGL(TM) commands.
Hence, in most cases, in order to use it, all you need to 
do is install:
 
 - a C++ compiler
 - the C++ standard library
 - an implementation of the OpenGL(TM) api

Rear has been developed using GNU gcc as the c++ compiler, 
Mesa as the implementation of OpenGL. It has been tested on 
the following Debian-like platforms:

 - Debian Lenny (5.0.5)
   with gcc 4.3.2
   with Mesa 7.0.3
 
 - Ubuntu Karmic Koala (9.10)
   with gcc 4.4.1
   with Mesa 7.6.0

If you are not using a Debian-like package manager, and would 
like to compile Mesa yourself, you will have to install a 
number of additional libraries. They are all free software, so
just google for their source code. 
Here is a working configuration for Debian Lenny:

  - libdrm >= 2.4.3 or <= 2.4.14
  - dri2proto 2.3
  - xxf86vm (repo)
  - xdamage 1.1.1.1
  - libexpat 2.0.1
  - x11-proto-gl-dev (repo)
  - freeglut3 2.4.0
  - Mesa 7.6.0

Be adviced that, when compiling freeglut, you could get a 
compilation error regarding lines 1687-1688 of 
freeglut-joystick.c
Just open that file with a text editor and comment them, 
since they are not needed by rear.

Compiling
---------
Once you are done with writing the code of your 
custom classes, just put the source file within 
the /src directory and, then, add the objects to 
Makefile targets. Then, you will only have to type 

    $make
    $make run

Rear comes with some example custom classes, so could 
find useful to have a look at them.
For a complete programming guide, please refer to the 
techical report included in the /doc directory.

Good luck, and happy coding.
