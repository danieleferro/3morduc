Installation
============

You can grab the current distribution of Miru here:

    **Miru 0.0.2** http://miru.enterthefoo.com/releases/Miru-0.0.2.tar.gz


You can grab the latest sources from the mercurial repository as well:

   ``hg clone http://hg.enterthefoo.com/Miru Miru``

There is also a dependency-bundled version of Miru (including Twisted, 
zope.interface and pyeuclid) which will allow you to play around 
with Miru to see the gruel I've generated and decide for yourself if it's
even worth bothering with before properly installing the dependencies:

    **Miru 0.0.2 (w/ deps)** http://miru.enterthefoo.com/releases/Miru-bundled-0.0.2.tar.gz

If you want to install globally to your python installation,
do the usual thing:

::

    $ python setup.py install

A side note: Anything "C" in either Twisted or zope.interface
is strictly an optional C optimization - and trust me, you don't really
need these C optimizations for Miru. Distutils and setuptools may trick
you into beliveing that you have to *build* zope.interface and Twisted
This simply isn't true. [#]_
